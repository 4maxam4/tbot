TBot is a testing/automation tool that is focused on usage in embedded development.
At its core TBot just provides utilities for interaction with remote hosts/targets
and an extensive library of routines that are common in embedded development/testing.

TBot aims to be a support for the developer while working on a project and without
much modification also allow running tests in an automated setting (CI).
